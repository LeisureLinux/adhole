# Title: ðŸ’Š Dandelion Sprout's Anti-Malware List (Â«hostsÂ» file version)
# Version: 10April2023v1
# Expires: 2 days
# Description: This list goes the extra kilometer to prevent more malware than other mainstream anti-malware lists. It blocks heavily abused top-level domains (and even search engine results for them), blocks domains used in malware redirection trains and in domain parking schemes, blocks sponsored Windows PUP nags on PC guide articles, uses mass blocking of domains belonging to bad IPs, and has many other subcategories that give it a solid advantage over similar lists out there.
# â€”â€”â€” Bad top-level domains â€”â€”â€”
# You can expect these domains to have an overwhelming majority of malware domains that have nothing to do with the countries in question. Nevertheless, if you are in a situation where you have to do active business in any of the countries in question, then this list may not be ideal for you.
# When asking us to whitelist a site: Make sure the site has some sort of public content. Non-public sites and alias sites are usually not whitelisted.
# Tokelau (Put on break due to too many whitelistings being needed)
# Gabon
# Mali (Put on break due to too many and too frequent whitelistings being needed)
# Equatorial Guinea
# Central African Republic
# Palau
# Legitimate use is almost non-existent, but has a tiny userbase in Japan. Its extreme common-ness in malware redirections means that the entry will be kept forever.
# International topical domains that have consistently horrendous scores on watchlists of bad TLDs, and whose use for legit purposes is practically non-existent.

# Description: This is a blocklist to block smart-TVs sending metadata back home, sometimes with the added benefit of blocking interface ads for apps and movie services.
# Please help with collecting domains!
# It could occur that the TV fails to receive new updates, or that other apps or services no longer work. Please report such an incident.
# Make sure to also use the extra RegEx list at https://perflyst.github.io/PiHoleBlocklist/regex.list, which helps remove regional LG ad domains among other things.
